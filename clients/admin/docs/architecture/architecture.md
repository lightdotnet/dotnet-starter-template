# Architecture: admin

Structure, boundaries, and dependency direction of the admin client. This file stays at the
"stable shape" altitude — per-feature behaviour, the route table, and the endpoint list live in
[overview.md](./overview.md); package references and the full barrel-bypass inventory live in
[dependency-graph.md](./dependency-graph.md).

## Layering

Feature-folder layering, split across two top-level roots under `clients/admin/src/`:

```text
src/
  app/                  routing only. Every page.tsx is a one-line re-export from a feature/module
                         barrel — no logic in app/. Root + (dashboard) error.tsx boundaries branch on
                         isRecoverableDeploymentError (deploy-stale-tab self-recovery); (dashboard)/
                         loading.tsx is a centered spinner cascading to nested routes; api/health/
                         route.ts is a static 204 liveness probe. /administration, /organization,
                         /settings are nav-only placeholders with no page.tsx.
  features/home/         the one feature not moved under modules/ — components/, constants/nav-item.ts,
                         index.ts; no api/ of its own (calls other modules' barrels/actions).
  modules/<domain>/<name>/
                         identity/{auth,user-profile,users,roles}, notifications (flat, no nesting),
                         organization/{companies,departments,employees}, approvals, leave-requests.
                         Each owns: api/ (one consolidated <name>.api.ts + one file per *-action.ts
                         Server Action), components/, optional types/ (single-consumer, or a
                         barrel-re-exported feature DTO), optional constants/ ({permissions,nav-item}.ts),
                         and an index.ts barrel — the only sanctioned cross-module import surface.
  components/
    ui/                  shadcn-CLI primitives + a few hand-written/hand-modified additions
                         (native-select, popover, command, combobox, button-group). Leaf layer.
    foundation/          use-listbox / use-virtual-list / floating-overlay (serve components/command/*
                         and the virtualized DataTable body) + portal-container.ts (React Context
                         letting a Popover portal into an open Dialog's own DOM node).
    command/             Cmd/Ctrl+K palette; reached via components/shared/search-box.tsx.
                         CommandPaletteProvider has no consumer.
    layout/             app chrome — topbar, sidebar, app-shell, breadcrumbs, user-menu, session-gate
                         (+ session-loading / session-unreachable overlays), deployment-recovery-notice.
    theme/             theme + accent-color providers/pickers, use-has-mounted.
    shared/            cross-feature building blocks with no feature knowledge: data-table/,
                         search-box.tsx, access-denied.tsx, local-date-time.tsx, object-viewer/ (unused).
    toast/             themed sonner wrapper (notifySuccess / notifyError).
  hooks/               use-sidebar, use-scrolled, use-guarded-action, use-action-success-toast.
  lib/
    server/            server-only (import "server-only" on line 1 of all 18 files): http.ts,
                         call-guard.ts, config.ts, the session + cookie-codec + JWT + refresh chain,
                         api-clients.ts / backend-api.ts (bearer-token handler pipeline),
                         require-permission.tsx (the one .tsx module here — returns JSX).
    shared/            client-safe helpers: utils.ts (cn), menu.ts, authorization.ts,
                         dedupe-claims.ts, user-display.ts, deployment-recovery.ts ("use client").
  constants/nav-items.ts  assembly only — imports each feature/module's own NavItem (by direct file
                         path, not barrel — see Dependency Direction) and composes NAV_ITEMS.
  types/               api.ts, claim.ts, nav.ts, session.ts.
  proxy.ts             thin auth gate only — decrypt / validate / hydrate the session cookie(s),
                         enforce the hard 7-day session cap, keep /login unreachable once authenticated.
                         No token refresh, no feature/module imports.
```

`app/*` pages are pure re-exports from a feature/module barrel; each feature/module owns its own
`api/` + `components/` + optional `types/`/`constants/`, exposed through one `index.ts`.
`components/layout/*` and `components/theme/*` (app chrome) compose `components/ui/*` +
`hooks/*` + `lib/shared/*`; `components/shared/*` and `components/toast/*` are cross-feature,
feature-agnostic building blocks at the same layer; `components/ui/*` is the leaf primitive layer.

**Nav tree assembly**: each nav-bearing feature/module owns one `NavItem` in its `constants/nav-item.ts`
(label, href, icon, and — where gated — the permission). `constants/nav-items.ts` only *assembles*
these into `NAV_ITEMS`, declaring itself just the two group nodes (`/administration`, `/organization` —
each spans multiple modules) and the `/settings` leaf (no owning feature). Final order:
`[home, Administration group, Organization group, /approvals, /leave-requests, /settings]` — the last
two are top-level leaves, not nested in either group. `Sidebar` and the topbar `SearchBox` both filter
this same tree client-side via `lib/shared/menu.ts`'s `buildVisibleMenu(NAV_ITEMS, can)`.

## Dependency Direction

Verified via actual `import` statements. An arrow means "is imported by", never the reverse.
See [dependency-graph.md](./dependency-graph.md#circular-references) for the full, current
barrel-bypass exception list and rationale.

```text

        ^                                        feature/module. One narrow exception: ui/{dialog,
        |                                        popover}.tsx import foundation/portal-container.ts.

        |                                        reversals — lib/server/refresh-session.ts ->
        |                                        identity/auth/api/token.api.ts, and
        |                                        lib/server/refetch-profile.ts ->

```

No cycles found among internal imports.

## Key Design Patterns

- **Feature/module folder + barrel export.** Every feature/module owns `api/`, `components/`, and
  optionally `types/`/`constants/`, exposed through a single `index.ts` that is the only sanctioned
  cross-module import. A reasoned set of direct-file-import exceptions exists — see
  [dependency-graph.md](./dependency-graph.md#circular-references).

- **One consolidated API file per feature/module; Server Actions kept separate.** Each `api/` has one
  `<name>.api.ts` wrapping every backend call that feature makes (not one file per endpoint); each
  `*-action.ts` Server Action is its own file, including read-only actions a Client Component needs but
  can't fetch itself (e.g. `get-approver-candidates-action.ts`). `resolve-session.ts` is deliberately
  its own file — cookie-only, no backend call.

- **Server-only API layer with normalized envelopes.** `lib/server/http.ts` (`requestJson`/`requestVoid`)
  is the single fetch wrapper; every `<name>.api.ts` returns a normalized result via `call-guard.ts`'s
  `guardCall`/`guardResponseCall`/`guardRawCall`. A non-2xx throws a typed `HttpError` carrying the
  status, which `call-guard.ts` maps to the backend's `ResultCode` vocabulary — this is what lets the
  refresh flow tell a dead token (401/400) from a network blip. **Every backend response is
  envelope-wrapped** — `guardRawCall` is almost never correct here.

- **Auth-token injection via a request-handler pipeline.** `http.ts` has no `accessToken` option — it
  takes `handlers` run before `fetch`. `lib/server/backend-api.ts`'s `createBackendApiClient(client)`
  factory pre-wires `bearerTokenHandler` (reads the ambient session) and a fixed backend client; five
  instances (`identityApi`/`notificationsApi`/`organizationApi`/`approvalApi`/`leaveManagementApi`)
  cover the five backend modules. Pre-session call sites pass `explicitBearerTokenHandler(token)`
  instead. `http.ts` never imports sessions.

- **Session freshness moved off blocking middleware into a client-driven gate.** `proxy.ts` now only
  enforces the 7-day cap and the `/login` redirect. `components/layout/session-gate.tsx` (mounted in
  `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) drives `ensureFreshSessionAction()` — a state machine
  (`checking`/`ready`/`unreachable`) showing a full-page overlay while checking on hard navigation,
  retrying a transient failure up to 2× (then polling every 5s), and force-logging-out after
  `MAX_REFRESH_FAILURES` (3) consecutive *permanent* refresh failures rather than riding out the
  7-day cap. A silent 60s background interval keeps a long-open soft-nav-only session fresh.

- **Near-expiry refresh centralized with a distinguishable failure verdict.**
  `lib/server/refresh-session.ts`'s `refreshSessionIfNearExpiry(session)` returns a `RefreshOutcome`
  union (`skipped` / `success` / `failed{permanent}`) so callers separate "not due" from "attempted
  and failed", and transient (network/5xx) from permanent (401/400 — refresh token itself invalid).
  `ensureFreshSessionAction` and `get-signalr-token-action.ts` both call it; only the former does the
  failure-counting.

- **Minimal encrypted cookie storage, hydrated on every read.** The `admin_session` cookie persists
  only `StoredSession` (tokens, expiries, profile, `refreshFailureCount`, `extraClaims`) —
  `claims`/`permissions`/`roles` are dropped and re-derived from the access-token JWT on every read.
  `cookie-codec.ts` splits the encrypted payload across numbered chunk cookies past `MAX_CHUNK_BYTES`
  as a backstop against the browser's silent ~4096-byte per-cookie limit; every write clears the
  cookie names it isn't using.

- **Permissions/roles decoded from the JWT, never trusted from the profile API.** `lib/server/jwt.ts`
  extracts the `permission`/`role` claim types from the access token (no signature check — issued by
  this app's own backend); `build-session-claims.ts` unions with the profile API's claims for display
  only. Both `loginAction` and `refreshSession()` re-derive on every token issuance.

- **Shared `requirePermission` / `AccessDenied` page gate.** `lib/server/require-permission.tsx`
  resolves the session (redirecting to `/login` if none), checks the permission, and returns
  `{ session, denied }`; a page does `if (denied) return denied;` before its own fetch. Every gated
  page uses this. `modules/leave-requests` is the deliberate exception — its pages call
  `resolveSession()` directly (no view permission exists); `LEAVE_REQUESTS_PERMISSIONS.Manage` is
  checked ad hoc to branch UI, not to gate the route.

- **Fetch full detail on dialog open — list DTOs are incomplete.** `UserService`/`RoleService` list
  projections never populate `Roles`/`Claims`; only `GetByIdAsync` does. Edit dialogs re-fetch full
  detail on open (via a `get-*-detail-action.ts`) rather than trusting the row they were opened with,
  which would silently wipe those arrays on save. The picklist itself is fetched the same way (on
  open, not preloaded as a page prop). **Lazy tab-scoped variant**: `edit-employee-dialog.tsx` fetches
  the org-unit tree / level picklists only the first time the "Departments & Teams" tab is activated.

- **Three feature-owned duplicates of the on-demand user-search combobox, by design.**
  `notifications`, `organization/employees`, and `approvals` each re-implement the same
  debounced (300ms), min-3-char `searchUsersAction`-backed picker rather than sharing one — all three
  need a Server Action from `identity/users`, and `components/shared/*` may not depend on a
  feature/module. `leave-requests`'s approver picker is a different shape (a plain `NativeSelect` over
  a small pre-fetched candidate list), not a fourth instance.

- **Controlled form state alongside `useActionState`; force-remount via a bumped `key`.** Mutation
  dialogs keep their own `useState<FormValues>` in parallel — React resets *uncontrolled* fields once
  a Server Action settles, which would wipe input after a validation error. `useActionState` has no
  imperative reset, so each table/tree bumps a per-dialog key counter on open, forcing a fresh
  instance (fresh action state, fresh form state, fresh detail fetch).

- **Generic presentational `DataTable<TData>`.** `components/shared/data-table/` composes a toolbar,
  a body (skeleton / empty / error states), and a windowed-pagination footer — fully prop-controlled,
  no dependency on any feature or data-fetching library, every prop beyond `columns`/`data`/`rowKey`
  optional. Consumers range from full server-driven search+pagination (Users, Companies, Employees) to
  local client-side filtering (Roles) to a static pre-fetched `records` array with no real pagination
  (the Approvals tabs, `LeaveRequestsDataTable`). Optional per-column client-side sort and
  `virtualized`/`infinite` modes are additive; no current caller uses them.

- **Context-provider-per-concern for client state.** `SidebarProvider`, `AccentColorProvider`, the
  `next-themes` wrapper, and `NotificationsProvider` each own one slice via a throwing custom hook
  (call the underlying hook once, expose via Context, throw if consumed outside the provider). The
  first three persist to `localStorage`; `NotificationsProvider` wraps live server data + one shared
  SignalR connection instead. `SearchBox` is the counter-example — a single-consumer palette keeping
  state local rather than adopting the unused `CommandPaletteProvider`.

- **Toast via a themed `sonner` wrapper.** Call sites use `notifySuccess`/`notifyError` (`notify.ts`),
  never `sonner`'s `toast` directly; the visual theme is centralized in `toast-theme.ts`. Two small
  hooks (`use-guarded-action.ts`, `use-action-success-toast.ts`) centralize the run-action-then-toast
  and toast-on-`useActionState`-success patterns each dialog would otherwise duplicate. One deliberate
  exception: `create-user-dialog.tsx`'s domain-lookup result renders inline, not as a toast.

- **Deploy-induced stale-tab errors self-recover in the error boundaries.**
  `lib/shared/deployment-recovery.ts` (`"use client"`) recognizes a rotated Server Action ID / dropped
  chunk / mid-restart fetch failure / Next `E394`, then polls `/api/health` on a growing backoff and
  hard-reloads *only once the probe answers*, capped at 5 reloads / 5 min via `sessionStorage`. Both
  `error.tsx` boundaries branch on `isRecoverableDeploymentError(error)` before the generic alert.
  Backend-connectivity failures never reach this path — `guardCall` already turns those into a
  rendered `Result`.

- **Real-time push via SignalR — browser-direct, action-issued token, server-resolved hub URL.**
  `use-notifications.ts` opens a `HubConnection` straight from the browser to an absolute backend URL
  (not proxied). Both the hub URL and a short-lived access token come from `getSignalRTokenAction()`
  on every (re)connect — `SIGNALR_HUB_URL` is a server-only env var, not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-inlined, so
  changing it needs only a server restart. This is the one place the access token is readable by
  browser JS (a deliberate narrowing of the httpOnly-cookie invariant). Failed connects retry after
  30s; logging is pinned to `LogLevel.Critical` to silence expected 1006 closures on route-away.

- **A Popover nested inside a Dialog portals into the Dialog's own node, not `document.body`.**
  `dialog.tsx` centers via a flex wrapper (not a `transform`, which would break a nested Popover's
  fixed-position math) and hands its DOM node down through `foundation/portal-container.ts`;
  `popover.tsx` reads that context for `Popover.Portal`'s `container`, so Radix's modal scroll lock
  treats the Popover as inside the dialog. Automatic for any future `Combobox`/`Popover` in a `Dialog`.

- **List-mutating Server Actions self-invalidate via `revalidatePath`.** Each create/update/delete
  action for Users, Roles, Notifications, Companies, Approvals, and Leave requests calls
  `revalidatePath` for its list route right before returning success. Deliberately not applied to
  client-managed reads (notification mark-read) or on-demand detail/picklist fetches; the Approvals
  tables and `LeaveRequestsDataTable` use a client-side `router.refresh()` / per-tab refetch instead.

## Module / Route Boundaries

Two route areas: `(dashboard)` (wraps every authenticated page with `resolveSession()` + `SessionGate`
+ `AppShell`) and the ungrouped `/login` (root layout only, no shell). One non-page route,
`app/api/health/route.ts`, is excluded from the `proxy.ts` matcher.

Every leaf under the "Administration"/"Organization" groups and `/approvals` is gated on that feature's
own `View`/`Read` permission via `requirePermission()`. `/leave-requests` (and `/leave-requests/[id]`)
is deliberately ungated — only a valid session; `leave.requests.manage` is checked ad hoc inside the
page to unlock the "All requests" tab and delete-any, never as a route gate. `/administration`,
`/organization`, `/settings` have no `page.tsx` and 404 if followed; being ungated, they still appear
in the sidebar and ⌘K palette.

Feature/module isolation is enforced by convention (barrel-only cross-module imports) with a reasoned
exception set — see [dependency-graph.md](./dependency-graph.md#circular-references). A genuine
`import type`-only sibling dependency exists between `organization/departments` and
`organization/employees` (erased at compile time, no runtime cycle).

## Shared Kernel / Common Building Blocks

- `components/ui/*` — the app's own primitive layer; `combobox.tsx` (+ `popover`/`command`) is the
  shadcn-style single-select, currently used only by `identity/users`' edit dialog.
- `components/foundation/*` — serve only `components/command/*`, the virtualized DataTable body, and
  (`portal-container.ts`) the Dialog/Popover nesting fix.
- `components/shared/data-table/*` — the generic list-table block; consumed by every list-bearing
  module with different search/sort/pagination wiring.
- `components/shared/{search-box,access-denied,local-date-time}.tsx`, `components/shared/object-viewer/*`
  (unused), `components/toast/*` — feature-agnostic; `access-denied.tsx` is returned by
  `require-permission.tsx`, not imported by feature code.
- `lib/shared/*` — client-safe helpers (`cn`, `menu.ts`, `authorization.ts`, `dedupe-claims.ts`,
  `user-display.ts`); `deployment-recovery.ts` is the browser-only outlier.
- `lib/server/*` — the server-only building blocks every `api/` layer sits on (`http.ts`,
  `call-guard.ts`, `config.ts`, the session/refresh chain, `require-permission.tsx`).
- Permission-string constants and `NavItem` metadata are **not** shared kernel — each lives in its
  owning feature/module's `constants/`, assembled (not owned) by `constants/nav-items.ts`.

`clients/admin` is still the only app under `clients/` — nothing is shared with a sibling app because
none exists. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` only configures build-script approval, not a multi-app workspace.

## Known Architectural Risks / Debt

| Finding | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `modules/approvals` doc coverage lags the module's current shape | Medium (doc debt) | Prose above still describes the pre-split module (single `/approvals` page, no document-type catalog, no `/approvals/requests/{id}` detail page or `ApprovalTimeline`, `approver-select` searching Identity users rather than linked employees). The api-file split (`approvals.api.ts` / `user-approvals.api.ts`) and lazy `ApprovalsTabs` loading *are* reflected; the rest needs a dedicated `analyze-client` pass. |
| `proxy.ts` uses Node's `crypto` with no explicit runtime pin | Low–Medium (verify) | `token-cipher.ts` (transitive via `cookie-codec.ts`) uses `createCipheriv`/`createDecipheriv`, unsupported on the classic Edge runtime. `proxy.ts` has no `export const runtime = "nodejs"`; behaviour is consistent with the `proxy.ts` convention defaulting to Node, but that's inferred, not pinned. |
| SignalR connects browser→backend directly, bypassing Next entirely | Medium (unverified) | Assumes backend CORS is configured for the admin origin — not verified anywhere in this client's code. If misconfigured, the handshake fails and retries silently every 30s. |
| `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be constant across deploys | Low (mitigated) | Unset ⇒ a fresh key per `next build` ⇒ every deploy rotates all Server Action IDs and open tabs hit "Failed to find Server Action". Deploy scripts hoist it from the preserved `standalone/.env`; `deployment-recovery.ts` recovers when churn happens; still must be generated once per server and never changed. |
| Nav items reference routes with no `page.tsx` (`/settings`, `/administration`, `/organization`) | Low | Group/placeholder nodes 404 if followed; ungated, so they surface in the sidebar and ⌘K palette. `/leave-requests` is ungated *by design*, not omission, and has a real page. |
| Detail-route breadcrumb shows a generic label for the id segment | Low (cosmetic) | `breadcrumbs.tsx` is path-based against `NAV_ITEMS`; `isOpaqueId()` renders `"Details"` for a UUID/hex/numeric segment. No channel for a detail page to inject a real crumb label. |
| Localized timestamps use the hydration-safe `LocalDateTime` only in `approvals`/`notifications`/`leave-requests` | Low | Other client-rendered `toLocaleString()` sites (`session-lifecycle.tsx`, `object-viewer/utils.ts`) still use the bare form. |
| Backend list endpoints never populate `Roles`/`Claims` on the DTO | Low (worked around) | Only `GetByIdAsync` populates them. Both edit dialogs re-fetch on open; any future list-reading feature would silently get empty arrays if it forgot to. |
| No `not-found.tsx` anywhere under `app/` | Low (cosmetic) | An unmatched route renders Next's default 404 in the root layout only, unmounting the whole `(dashboard)` subtree (and any open SignalR connection). |
| `prettier` + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` installed, no config file / `format` script | Low | Unknown whether formatting is enforced anywhere. |
| No automated test suite | Low (by design at this stage) | No test runner in `package.json`. Notable given the `SessionGate`/`ensureFreshSessionAction` state machine, the `deployment-recovery.ts` loop, and every CRUD/decision flow are untested. |
| `components/ui/{button,tabs,dialog}.tsx` hand-modified beyond shadcn CLI output | Low | Re-running the CLI would silently drop the customizations (`button` `loading` prop + `cursor-pointer`, `tabs` `cursor-pointer`, `dialog` `max-h`/`overflow-y-auto` + portal-container). |
| `DataTable`'s `onExport` prop, `components/shared/object-viewer/*`, `CommandPaletteProvider` — all unused | Low / Trivial | Dead capability until a consumer needs it. |
| `eslint.config.mjs`'s `react-hooks/refs` override glob lists a non-existent `src/components/select/**` | Trivial | No-op glob; remove next time the file is touched. |
| `LeaveRequestsPage`'s "All requests" tab resolves employee names via one unscoped, capped fetch | Low | `searchEmployees({ pageSize: 200 })` with no filter; an org over 200 employees, or a manager lacking `organization.employees.view`, falls back to the raw id (marked best-effort in code). |
