# Workflow: New Session

Run this at the start of every session in this repository.

## Steps

1. **Read the root `CLAUDE.md`.** This is the source of truth for operating rules, agent/skill/workflow index, and where project-specific documentation lives. Do not skip even if this feels like a quick task.
2. **Do not read anything else yet.** Wait for the user's actual request before loading further context.
3. **Once the request is known, load only required context**:
   - If it names a module/project/client app, jump straight there (`Glob` for the relevant `.csproj` directly under `src/` or route folder under `clients/<app-name>/`, don't tree-walk the repo).
   - If it's ambiguous which module or client app applies — including which app once `clients/` has more than one — ask rather than scanning broadly to figure it out.
   - If the repo (or the relevant part of it) hasn't been scaffolded yet, say so rather than assuming structure — see [scaffold-project](scaffold-project.md) if the user wants it created.
   - Check the scoped doc(s) for already-verified facts before re-deriving them from code: `src/CLAUDE.md`/`src/docs/` for backend tasks, `clients/<app-name>/CLAUDE.md`/`clients/<app-name>/docs/` for client tasks. Use the `/context-backend`, `/context-frontend`, or `/context-full` commands ([commands/](../commands/)) to load the right set in one step, or read root `docs/integration.md` directly for the cross-cutting summary.
4. **Identify relevant agents** from root `CLAUDE.md` §4 that match the request's domain (backend architecture, EF Core, API, frontend architecture, security, performance, testing, docs, dependencies) — plan to delegate rather than doing deep multi-domain analysis inline.
5. **Identify relevant skills/workflows** from `.claude/WORKFLOWS.md` and root `CLAUDE.md` §9 (quick reference table) that match the request's shape.
6. **Read only the necessary files** for the identified scope — no speculative exploration.

## Output

Nothing to report yet — this workflow just establishes context before doing the actual requested work. Proceed directly into the matched skill/workflow/agent once identified.
